# Big Data Approach to Handling Imbalanced Datasets with Random Forest: A Comprison of Sequential, Local and Global Solutions

With the increasing number of cryptocurrency transactions, crypto-ransomware incidents have also grown. This study compares the performance of local and global implementation in classifying different crypto ransomware using BitcoinHeist data. The local model involves repartitioning the data and using the MapPartitions function to fit decision trees on each of the partitions. The predictions of every model on the partitions are then aggregated and the majority is presented as the output class. Alternatively, global implementation is used to train one classifier based on all training data. The data, therefore, is not split into multiple partitions and decision trees are fitted on the entirety of the training data. The accuracy, memory allocation, and computation time are measured using the Spark UI.
